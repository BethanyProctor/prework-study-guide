        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The link element connects an external resoursce to the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply (such as the color) and the value of the property (such as blue).</li>
          <li>Examples of CSS rules: height, width, margin-left or -right, font-size, text-align, background-color, text size.</li>
          <li>display: block assigns each item to start on a new line.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use keyword "const" to create variables that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li>After the "const" keyword, give the variable its unique name, followed by = as an assignment operator.</li>
          <li>Use the strict equality operator === to check if two values are equal and to get a Boolean result true if they are equale and false if they are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is usually related in some way.</li>
          <li>Array index: the location of the data item in the array (starting at 0 and increasing by 1). For example, const name [0, 1, 2]</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Use "let" followed by a unique variable name and = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable, and be able to reassign the value over time.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop has three important statements: starting point for the loop (such as let x = 0), the condition, and the final statement that allows the array to iterate over each item (such as x++).</li>
